# UdacityInvestDataset

This repository contains data files for a Udacity project.
The project is connected with the Introduction to Data Analysis course.
A movie database file has been downloaded. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from the Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
In this project, I first clean the data, then explore relationships between production-related features (runtime, budget, genre, ...) and user rating. I also investigate the relationship betwee user rating and revenue. I use graphs to illustrate these relationships. In the end, conclusions are given.
